/**
 * The `/` panel must escape its host's clipping box.
 *
 * Every host puts the composer inside something that clips: `DialogContent` is
 * `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)] overflow-y-auto`, and the automation editor's form
 * scrolls. As an ordinary absolutely-positioned child the panel was cut off at
 * the dialog's edge whenever the composer sat low in it — z-index cannot beat
 * `overflow`. These pin the two properties that fix it: the panel is portalled
 * out to the body and positioned against the viewport, and it re-enables its own
 * pointer events (a modal Radix layer sets `pointer-events: none` on the body,
 * which would otherwise make the panel click-dead and turn a press on it into an
 * outside-press that closes the host).
